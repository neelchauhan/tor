  o Major bugfixes (onion service):
    - Report back HS circuit failure back into the HS subsytem so we take
      appropriate action with regards to the client introduction point failure
      cache. This improves reachability of onion services, since now clients
      notice failing introduction circuits properly. Fixes bug 32020; bugfix on
      0.3.2.1-alpha;
    - If an rendevous point fails multiple times, we mark the intro point as
      bad when cleaning up the circuit. This helps avoid buggy or malicious
      intro points. Fixes bug 32614. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
