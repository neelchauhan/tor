  o Minor bugfixes (ipv4, address parsing):
    - In tor_inet_aton(), parse the IPv4 address for leading zeros in the
      octets, and reject the address if one exists and succeding characters
      exist. Leading zeros usually occurs in addresses like 010.010.010.010
      which is an obsolete notation for octal IPv4 addresses. Fixes bug
      32363; bugfix on 0.4.1.6. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
