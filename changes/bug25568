  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When a client receives an intro point descriptor, reject duplicate
      entries when we are processing the descriptor. This prevents clients
      from re-trying intro points which have failed, and affects both
      version 2 and version 3 onion services. Previously, we re-try
      duplicate entries even if they have failed Fixes bug 25568;
      bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
