  o Minor bugfixes (coding best practices checks):
    - Stop advertising an IPv6 exit policy when DNS is broken for IPv6 by
      marking the relay descriptor dirty for 24 hours, not advertising an
      IPv6 exit policy with a dirty descriptor, and then resetting the
      IPv6 DNS broken count every 24 hours. Fixes bug 33375; bugfix on
      0.2.9.14. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
