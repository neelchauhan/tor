  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When establishing connections or circuit between onion service entries,
      only allow one control cell for each type except for INTRODUCE2 cells.
      Previously, we only allowed one of INTRODUCE1 but unlimited of everything
      else. Fixes bug 30466; bugfix on 0.0.6. Patch by Neel Chauhan
