  o Minor bugfixes (networking):
    - Whenever possible, use functions like tor_addr_is_v4() to check the IP
      address family rather than comparing family directly. We introduce
      tor_addr_is_v6() and tor_addr_is_unspec() to do for IPv6 and unspecified
      addresses what tor_addr_is_v4() does for IPv4. Also, we reject IPv4-
      mapped IPv6 addresses in tor_addr_is_v4(). Fixes bug 24546; bugfix on
      0.2.0.3-alpha. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
