  o Major features (directory authority, ed25519):
      Add support for banning a relay's ed25519 keys in the approved-routers
      file. This will allow us to migrate away from RSA keys in the future.
      Previously, only RSA keys could be banned in approved-routers. Resolves
      ticket 22029. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
