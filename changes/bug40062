  o Minor features (onion services):
    - When writing an onion service hostname file, first read it to make
      sure it contains what we want before attempting to write it. Now
      onion services can set their existing onion service directories to
      read-only and Tor will still work. Resolves ticket 40062. Patch by
      Neel Chauhan.
