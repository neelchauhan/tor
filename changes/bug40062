  o Major bugfixes (onion services):
    - When writing an onion service hostname file, first read it to make
      sure it contains what we want before attempting to write it. This
      prevents a bug where we can't read an onion service directory if it's
      read-only. Fixes bug 40062; bugfix on 0.0.6. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
