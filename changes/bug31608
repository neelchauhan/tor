  o Minor bugfixes (circuit):
    - In origin_circuit_init(), change the circuit state after
      allocating build_state. This allows circuit_state_publish()
      to run. Previously, we changed the state before allocating,
      which meant circuit_state_publish() never ran. Fixes bug
      31608; bugfix on 0.1.1.23. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
