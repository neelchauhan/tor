  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - On an intro point, if we have sent an ACK on an introduction circuit
      for a version 3 onion service, we should close the intro circuit as
      clients already close it on their side. Previously, we closed the
      circuits on on NACK, but that prevents clients from re-extending to
      a new IP, and reqires another round trip for a DESTROY cell. Fixes
      bug 27841; bugfix on 0.3.6.1-alpha. Patch by Neel Chaunan
