  o Minor features (ipv6):
    - If ClientAutoIPv6ORPort is set and we fail IPv4 or IPv6 connections, mark
      the number of failures based on the IP version. This is used to prefer
      the more reliable IP version. If we automatically fail a version, mark
      it as "failed" and avoid it. These counters expire after a week. Closes
      ticket 27491. Patch by Neel Chauhan.
