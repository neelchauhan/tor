  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When we clean up intro circuits for a v3 onion service, don't remove
      circuits that have an established circuit even if they tried more
      than three times. Previously, we cleaned on three retries even if an
      circuit has established. Fixes bug 31652; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
      Patch by Neel Chauhan.
