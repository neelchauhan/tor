  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When we launch an intro circuit for a v3 onion service, reject intro
      points circuits that retried more than the maximum of three times.
      Previously, we allowed intro points that tried more than thrice to
      launch and they got killed in cleanup_intro_points() even if they
      succeeded. Fixes bug 31652; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha. Patch by Neel
      Chauhan.
