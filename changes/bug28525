  o Minor bugfixes (address selection):
    - Make Tor aware of the RFC 6598 (Carrier Grade NAT) IP range, which is the
      subnet 100.64.0.0/10. This is deployed by many ISPs as an alternative to
      RFC 1918 that does not break existing internal networks. This patch fixes
      security issues caused by RFC 6518 by blocking control ports on these
      addresses and warns users if client ports or ExtORPorts are listening on
      a RFC 6598 address. Fixes bug 28525; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha. Patch by
      Neel Chauhan.
