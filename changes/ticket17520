  o Minor features (onion services):
    - Increase the rendezvous cache failure cleanup timer to two minutes
      from 30 seconds. This is to reduce the CPU usage as the cache could
      grow to the number of every introduction point. Also, when looking
      up a rendezvous cache entry, if an entry expired, remove it and
      return that "we do not have an entry". Closes ticket 17520. Patch
      by Neel Chauhan.
