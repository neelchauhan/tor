  o Minor features (ipv6):
    - If ClientPreferIPv6ORPort is set to auto and a relay is being chosen
      for a Directory or ORPort connection, we choose IPv4 or IPv6 at random.
      Previously, we preferred to IPv4 if ClientPreferIPv6ORPort is auto
      except when an IPv6 bridge was specified. Closes ticket 27490. Patch
      by Neel Chauhan.
